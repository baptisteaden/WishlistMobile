# Wishlist Mobile

⚠️ Under construction ⚠️
Small social media centered on gifts you make to your family/friends:

- Each person maitain a wish list for any occasion (birthday, christmas, etc)
- People can consult, mark as 'shopped' and write comments on gifts
- All theses activities are not visible for the person wishing the gifts

This is a mobile app using React Native on the front-end and express for the back-end API. A web app using the same API + Vue.js might also come up later so stay tuned!

Todo list:
[x] Install and setup react native
[x] First connection between the native app & the express API server
[x] Setup & first connection to an sqlite db
[x] Move code in `SignIn.js`
[x] Code `Home.js` skeleton = topbar with icons: home, my wishlist, friends
[x] Make frkin BottomNavigation work...........................
[x] Make frkin React Navigation work...........................
[x] Form to add a gift to MyWishlist
[x] Code `MyWishlist.js`: working add button + listing
[x] setListData on goBack to actually see the new wish
[x] Temporar deletion onLongPress
[x] More details on the wishlist listing
[x] Be able to update a gift onPress
[x] See how people do and try to have a decent server architecture
[ ] And then... Moving to `Friends.js` I guess? :)
